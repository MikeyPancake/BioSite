                    Alaska and Nevada. After leaving the Airforce in 2011, she began attending school to become a registered nurse with the goal of continuing to service in the medical field.

                    Jennifer has remained at her current employer for going on eight years because she loves working around individuals whose she has a direct influence on how they 
                    treat their health. In 2015, Jennifer met her husband, and they welcomed their daughter, Olivia, into the world in 2016.

                    responsibilities of a Compliance officer. Upon accepting the new position, Jennifer has also made changes in the company compliance department which have 
                    earned her practice some of the highest accolades possible. Jennifer has almost completed her BA degree and will purse continued education to where she hopes 
                    to earn her master degree in healthcare. When Jennifer is not working, she loves to spend time with her husband, two kids, and two animals where they spend a 
                    lot of time on the beautiful waters of the Emerald Coast.
